Work Breakdown Agreement

Assignment 2 consists of 3 Different Parts which are as follows
a)	Login System
b)	Bidding System
c)	Contract System

Both members of the grup have determined that by the 9th of May 2021, we should have completed the code and the Class Diagrams.
The workload is split evenly. It was agreed upon that Rana would do the login system and Contract system whereas Altaf would do the bidding system seeing as it is divided into two different sections. We would each construct the User Interfaces of our respective sections as well as the integration of the said sections with the API and we would also construct the class diagrams of our respective sections.
